# - READ THIS BEFORE USING IT -

* If you want to use ESP TeamChecker, make sure that the ESP is off, first turn on TeamChecker, then you should turn on ESP
* If there is someone without the ESP, just turn off then turn on it, but if this happens while you use TeamChecker, turn off both and then turn off them again
* If the TeamChecker AimLock or ESP glitch, just turn off the TeamChecker and the ESP or AimLock and then turn on them again

# Info

This script is in a BETA Version, please, if you find any glitch DM me
